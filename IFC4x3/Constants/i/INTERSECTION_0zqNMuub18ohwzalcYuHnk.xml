	<Documentation>The referent is the location of an intersection specified by the referent name. The intersection location is typically taken as the location of the intersection of the reference lines of the streets comprising the intersection and is, therefore, not necessarily precise or deterministic. Physical markers may be installed to remedy this. The Linear Referencing System should include specific rules about how intersection locations are determined if this type of referent is permitted.</Documentation>
