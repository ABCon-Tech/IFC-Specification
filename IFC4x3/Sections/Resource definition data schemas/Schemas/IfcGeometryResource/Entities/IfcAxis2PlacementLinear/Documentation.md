The _IfcAxis2PlacementLinear_ provides location and orientation to place items in a three-dimensional space confined to the context of a curve. Relative placement axes (Axis and RefDirection) are relative to the curve used for linear referencing provided in _IfcPlacement_ _Location_ (_IfcPointByDistanceExpression_ _BasisCurve_), maintaining the relationship to the tangent of the curve.
