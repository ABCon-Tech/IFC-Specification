Spirals are curves that revolve around a point while increasing its length. In general, these curves are parameterized in the following way:
x = r(φ) cosφ
y = r(φ) sinφ

In the case of the clothoid and higher order transition spirals, the parametrization is:
x = ∫cos&Thetadl
y = ∫sin&Thetadl

where &Theta is the deflection or in other notation the tangen angle and dl the differential of the spiral length.
