A signal is an active device that conveys information or instructions to users, by means of an audio, visual signal or a combination of both.
The primary distinction from an _IfcSign_ is that a signal is active and therefore a subtype of _IfcFlowTerminal_ usually requiring power and data connections for its operation.
An instance of _IfcSignal_ represents a singular signalling device in a larger assembled unit or connected system, such as an individual frame within a railway signal, a single light unit in a traffic light system or an audio signal or light mounted on a navigational buoy.
Signals can be physically aggregated together into an assembly which can include multiple signal instances (and also sign instances) and the associated supporting structural elements such as a simple pole or a rigid frame gantry (see Signal Assembly for examples).
Signals can be logically (functionally) grouped together into a signalling system (a type of distribution system) to represent a connected  group of signals for example a group of traffic lights controlling an road intersection.
