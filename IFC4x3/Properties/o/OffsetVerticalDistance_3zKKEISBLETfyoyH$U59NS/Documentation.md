The measure of the vertical offset of the distance expression. This is the distance above or below the vertical offset referent (or, if no vertical offset referent is specified, then above or below the lateral offset referent if one is specified; otherwise, above or below the linear element being measured) to the position being specified. A positive (+) value is measured in the direction specified by the positive vertical offset direction of the LRM. A missing value or a value of 0 (zero) shall be interpreted as the absence of a vertical displacement.
